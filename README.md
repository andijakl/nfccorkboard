nfccorkboard
============

Extends the Qt Quick corkboards example of the Qt SDK with NFC functionality: touch a tag and its NDEF contents appear as a new note on the screen. Press the NFC flag of a note on the screen and its contents will be written to the tag. Parses URI, text, Smart Poster and vCard records and shows a generic post-it for all other tag types.
